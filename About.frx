ÿThis program was made so that I can become familiar with 
progress bars.  I guess I caught on pretty quickly.  I needed a 
progress bar for a game I was going to design so I tested it here 
first.  						
						
As far as I know, I eliminated all errors in the code.  If you 
find any errors please e-mail me at phantis86@hotmail.com.  I 
also have a website you can visit but it really old and needs 
updating (hopefully I will have it updated soon.)
