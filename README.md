### Description

This code shows how to hook a progress bar up to a timer accurately. You can stop and resume from where you left off. I designed this code for a game I plan on designing. It shows the percentage and it is easy to change the max value and increments of the progress bar during run-time. Please feel free to use the code as you like. I would really appreciate it if you can leave some feedback and vote. Thanks!
